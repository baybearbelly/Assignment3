/****************************************
Reviewer 1: You were definitely on the right track here! There are a couple of small changes I made, in the following order, 
to get your code running:

1. Declared the tabGroup variable on line 73
2. Opened win1 on line 7
  At this point, the initial Tea Strength portion of the app is functioning properly.
3. Declared the tab2 variable (the one for the camera) from line 122 to 127.
  At this point, there is a navigation tab group at the bottom of the screen, but no tab for the camera.
4. Added tab2 (the camera tab) to the navigation tab group on line 132.
  We now have the tea strength tab and camera tab linked together via the navigation tab group and both function.

Good work!
